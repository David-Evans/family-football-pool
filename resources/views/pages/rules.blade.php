                    <p>The website was long overdue for an overhaul, so I rolled up my sleeves, dove in and made some sweet changes:</p>
                    <h4>Important Stuff</strong></h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="text-danger">NOTICE: Games automatically lock at kick-off! If you don't make your picks on time, you get a big fat ZERO for that game. NO EXCEPTIONS! </span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>General Improvements</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Website is now optimized for mobile devices!</li>
                        <li>Introducing: <a href="chat">Smack Central</a>, a place for talkin' trash to your fellow competitors, <a href="chat">Check it out!</a></li>
                        <li>It's super easy to make picks and updated them (until game time)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Scoring</strong></h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You can only score points if your picks is accurate</li>
                        <li>For example, if you miss the Thursday game, you take a one game loss, but you still have time to pick the Sunday games</li>
                        <li>The season-long winner will have racked up the most wins</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>November 27, 2016</strong></h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fix issue with "view-my-picks" page</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>October 3, 2016</strong></h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Send SMS reminders before games start</li>
                        <li>Fix issue where current week ends <i>after</i> Monday, so picks can be seen</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>September 21, 2016</strong></h4>
                    <ul>
